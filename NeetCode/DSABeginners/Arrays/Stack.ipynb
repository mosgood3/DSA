    "A stack is a data structure that supports a subset of operations from a dynamic array. With a stack you may only add and delete elements from one end of the array (referred to as the top of the stack).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the physical world, a stack can be conceptualized by thinking of a stack of plates. You may grab a plate from the top or you may add a plate to the top. You cannot remove or add a plate to the middle of the stack. This is the same as the stack data structure.\n",
    "\n",

    "Stacks are a dynamic data structure that operate on a LIFO (Last In First Out) manner. The last element added to the stack is the first element that comes out. The stack supports three operations - push, pop, peek.\n",
    "Push\n",
    "\n",
    "The push operation adds an element to the top of the stack, which in dynamic array terms would be appending an element to the end. This is an efficient O(1)O(1) operation as discussed in the previous lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps to visualize a stack as an array that is vertical. The pseudocode demonstrates the concept, along with the visual where we add the integers 11 through 44 to the top. The top pointer updates to point at the last item added. The following pseudocode and visual demonstrates this."
