    "    It is also possible to implement a queue using a dynamic array, but is more involved. To get the same time complexity as a linked list, you would need to use a circular array and perform some additional operations. \n",

    "The main two operations that queues support are enqueue and dequeue. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to stacks, it is a good measure to check if the queue is empty before performing the dequeue opeartion.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a variation of the queue, a double-ended queue, known as a deque (pronounced \"deck\"). A deque allows you to add and remove elements from both the head and the tail in O(1)O(1) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important use cases for the queue is when performing breadth-first search for trees and graphs, which we will cover later in the course."
